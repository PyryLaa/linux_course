This repo contains my linux course excercises and the final bash scripting project.
Notable files/directories in the bash_project directory are at least the calc directory (coming soon) and the create_directory.sh script.

The create_directory.sh script creates a folder with the name specified by the user as the first argument to the script. Then it creates a .sh file with the same name
as the directory, gives the user execute rights for the file and appends #! /bin/bash to the file. Then it opens the file in emacs terminal window for editing.
Made the script to streamline my working.
